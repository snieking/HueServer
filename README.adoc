== Prerequisites

. *Git*: How to clone a project.
. *Maven*: Some knowledge on how to build a Maven project.

== Instructions

* Clone the repository and build it using Maven.
* Create a config.yml file in the same path as the *.jar* file with the following data
* If you want to enable the *Twitter scanning* to blink lights when match found, 
you also need to create a application.yml in *src/main/resources* before building the application 
(In the future I'm looking for a better way to implement this). In there enter the following information 
and fill it in with your appId and appSecret from the *Twitter API*.
** spring.social.twitter.appId: 
** spring.social.twitter.appSecret: 
* In this file you can also change the port that the program runs on with the following command:
** server.port:
